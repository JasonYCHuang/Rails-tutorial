This website is built base on RUBY ON RAILS TUTORIAL (3RD ED.) by Michael Hartl.
I adopt Rspec from RUBY ON RAILS TUTORIAL (2nd ED.) since Rspec is more popular in industry.

Moreover, I modified parts of code base on following gems.
1. Devise
2. nprogress-rails
3. font-awesome-rails
4. jquery-datatables-rails
